**Description :**  
In my acedamic course we performed some of the basic Image Processing Processing Techniques using MATLAB. 

**Structure :**  
I've attached MATLAB codes for various image processing techniques :
1. Performing Arithmatic operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division etc on two user-input images using in-built MATLAB functions.     
2. Performing Logical operations such as Logical AND, OR, XOR, Complement of image on two user-input images using in-built MATLAB functions.  
3. Performing Bit-Plane slicing on the given image.
